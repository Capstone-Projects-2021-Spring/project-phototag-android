# Project overview
PhotoTag is a mobile application designed in both Android and iOS which is designed to eliminate time spent by the user searching in their gallery for a specific image. With PhotoTag, users will be able to attach keywords to their existing photos with suggested tags from an image processing API, or choose to add their own custom keywords. These keywords will be used to search through the image collection for a smaller subset, for less total time spent searching for the user.
